As the benefits could vary each year, please do check with our Loan Counselor about the tax benefits which you could avail on your loan.What security will i have to provide?Security of the loan would generally be security interest on the property being financed by us and / or any other collateral / interim security as may be required by us.It is extremely important for you to ensure that the title to the property is clear, marketable and free from encumbrance. There should not be any existing mortgage, loan or litigation, which is likely to adversely affect the title to the property.When do i start repaying the principal amount?Repayment of the principal commences from the month following the month in which you avail full disbursement of your loan. Pending final disbursement, you pay interest on the portion of the loan disbursed. This interest is called pre-EMI interest. Pre-EMI interest is payable every month from the date of each disbursement up to the date of commencement of EMI.In the case of under construction properties, HDFC also offers you a unique ‘Tranching’ facility wherein you can choose the installments you wish to pay till the time the property is ready for possession.

    - text: " My money is locked with you.This is a pension plan which accumulates your money for the retirement kitty. Since this is for old age, it has a restricted liquidity. You can withdraw maximum up to 1/3rd of the money in case of an emergency after 5 years of commencement of the plan. However, the rest must be converted into annuity, and will be paid periodically. What is so special about this product?HDFC Life APP has benefits such as Capital Guarantee of 101% - 135% - APP is a unit linked plan that provides you the upside of the equity markets. However, to protect you from the market downfall, you have the Assured Vesting Benefit of 101% -135%, depending on the Premium Paying Term and Policy Term combination. This means that your capital is completely protected from any downsidePension Multipliers – As a Loyalty benefit, Pension Multipliers would be added to the fund value every alternate year starting from the end of 11th policy year. These additions will be equivalent to 1% of average fund value for the immediate preceding two years, subject to the policy being in force and all premiums paid till date.Early start to boost your corpus – With APP you can start your retirement planning as early as 18 years. The earlier you start, you would gain from the power of compounding and be able to build a bigger corpus before your retirementLower vesting age limits – The minimum vesting age of APP is 45 years, this would help you to plan for early retirement Is there an option to change the plan in between? What if you are not able to generate good returns?There is no option for changing of plans. What would be the annuity rates at the time of maturity?Annuity rates are a function of prevailing market conditions at the time the annuity is bought. Other factors that determine annuity rate are - gender, age, annuity option chosen & premium band. Hence, it would not be possible to commit on the annuity rate at this point. I have other sources of income. Do I still need to plan for retirement?Diversification of income source is good. However, as you get older, you might not be able to work the way you can now. The other sources of income might not turn out to be as successful as they are today. Hence, it is prudent to plan for your retirement through a pension plan. I don’t want to wait till 60 years for retirement. Is there a way out?This plan has a minimum vesting age of 45 years only, which would help to plan for an early retirement. You don’t need to wait till 60 years of age. However, once you have fixed your vesting age, it is recommended that you continue for the entire term. I already have a Saving & Investment Plan in place. Do I also need a Pension Plan? What purpose would it serve?It’s nice to hear that you have already made provisions for your savings. However, the objective of a Pension Plan is very different. Pension Plans are insurance plans that offer you an income/ pension after retirement when you may not have any other adequate source of income.This is not possible with any other plan. Moreover, pension plans can’t be liquidated easily, which ensures that your savings stay intact and a kitty is automatically built for your retirement. What is the HDFC Life Assured Pension Plan?The Assured Pension Plan is a Unit Linked Pension Plan recently launched by HDFC Life. This plan aims to help you plan for a steady income source for retirement. You can choose from a variety of Premium paying & policy term options as per your comfort and plan your retirement. HDFC Life APP provides you the benefit of equity participation with the comfort of a capital guarantee. To boost your fund value, you also have the pension multipliers that are added to your fund post 11th year. Why should I buy HDFC Life Assured Pension Plan?One of the biggest challenges of planning for your retirement is to ensure that you have saved enough money during your working years that will take care of your expenses once you retire. Given the rising cost of living, increased life expectancy and inflation, it is always wise to invest in a Pension Plan. HDFC Life Assured Pension Plan can help you achieve your retirement goals by planning for it well in advance.The charges seem very high, a lot of money would get deducted. This doesn’t look like a lucrative option to me.Yes, there are charges as every other ULIP plan, but there is also a Pension Multiplier from the 11th year onwards every alternate year. The longer policy term you go for, the more you gain through Pension Boosters added to the fund value.It is not possible for me to pay for such a long tenure since I have other commitments.HDFC Life APP comes to you with a host of flexibilities. You can choose a limited premium paying term of 8, 10 & 15 years. Also, there is an option to pay a lump sum through a single payment.HDFC Life APP is a ULIP Plan. Why don’t I get to choose the funds in this plan?HDFC Life APP provides you a guarantee (between 101% -135%) of the premiums paid. This is why the choice of funds are predefined as per the Equity Backing Ratio and is not available for customised allocation by customers. Are there any tax benefits available?The premiums paid by you are eligible for tax benefits under Section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961.Up to 1/3rd of the policy proceeds can be taken as tax-free commuted value, as prescribed under Sec 10 (10A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. When do I get to choose the annuity option?You need to give a default option now, i.e., at the time of purchase of this policy. However, depending on your situation, you always have the option to change/ alter the annuity option at the time of maturity of the pension policy. HDFC Life will get in touch with you 3-6 months before the maturity of the policy and you can revisit your annuity choice options then.In case you don’t revert to HDFC Life at that point of time, the default annuity options chosen earlier would be considered and your annuity payments would commence.However, after commencement of annuity you won’t be able to make any further alterations. Are top-ups allowed in this plan?There isn’t any provision of top-up premiums in this plan. What are the steps involved to purchase this policy quickly in case I am travelling and do not have much time?Taking you through the procedure and form filling - only KYC documents, signature on proposal form and payment instrument are required. You can also pay online through HDFC Bank NetBanking, Debit card or Credit card.This being a pension plan, you don’t need to go through any medicals. After your form is logged in, you would receive a verification call the next day. Once the verification call is closed with an affirmative from your end, your policy would be issued and the Policy Bond would be delivered to your Demat Account. This Demat Account is completely free of cost. Thus it would not take much time.I have a provision for pension from my employer, I don’t think there is any separate need for a pension plan.Pension from your employer is great. But with increase in the cost of living and increased life expectancy your employer funded pension might not be enough to pay for your entire expenses post retirement.As a thumb rule your retirement fund should be at least 20 times your last year income before retirement. Hence, it is advisable that you invest in a separate retirement plan so that it supplements your employer-funded pension scheme. I have 30 years to my retirement. Why do I need to plan now?This is the best part of your life. You have time on your side. So you can act now and ensure a smooth retirement.Please remember that retirement is inevitable & early planning for retirement is really helpful. The earlier you start investing in your retirement, the bigger would be your retirement kitty, thanks to the power of compounding. You can actually build up a larger sum with a comparatively smaller investment if you start early. So please think about this and act now. What if I am unable to pay the premiums for the entire term? Would you forfeit my money?There is no forfeiture clause in this product. In case you have discontinued before 5 years of commencement of the plan, you will have to wait till the completion of the 5th anniversary to utilise the benefits.If you discontinue the plan after 5 years, you get the proceeds right then.Utilisation of proceeds  You can withdraw up to 1/3rd and the rest must be converted into annuity. How would you utilise my funds?Your funds will be invested into Equity and Debt instruments as per the Equity Backing Ratio defined by the company. This is to provide you with maximum returns from market upside, as well as protect your capital from any downfall. What if I don’t require the fund at the time of vesting. Say I plan to work for some more years.HDFC Life APP provides you various options at vesting. You can choose between either of the two options Extend the accumulation period within the same policy with same terms & conditions as the original policy, provided you are below 55 years of ageUtilise the entire proceeds to purchase a single premium deferred pension plan from HDFC Life Do I get a life cover from this plan?APP being a Pension plan does not have a life cover; however, the death benefit is higher of FV or 105% of the premiums paid till date.

If that is not the case, unit-linked plans are the ideal vehicle for you to plan for your family’s future financial needs. Unit-linked plans are associated with transparent charging structure and certain flexibility, besides possessing the potential to deliver a higher amount on maturity. What do you mean by ‘switching funds’?Switching between funds implies that the policy holder can transfer his investments from one fund to another fund under the plan.

For instance, one may want to switch from an equity based fund to a debt fund when the equity markets are on a downslide. What are the different types of Savings Plans?You may choose between a traditional endowment plan and unit-linked insurance plan depending on a number of factors including your risk profile, your understanding of different financial instruments and your ability to track your investments regularly.

Providing a good education, establishing a professional career or even a modest wedding is becoming an expensive proposition with each passing year. Costs are increasing fast. Just imagine how much you will need when your young children tale these important steps in life in the future. With our Children’s Plans, you can start building regular savings today to help you secure your child’s immediate and future needs even when you are not around. Should I buy a plan in my Child’s name or in my own name?When purchasing a Life Insurance plan, it is important to remember that its main purpose is to replace an income that is lost in case of the unfortunate demise of the chief bread winner of the family (Life Assured). A child rarely has an income and therefore has no reason to be insured. If the Insurance Plan is taken in name of the child, the plan gets derailed in case of the unfortunate demise of the parent. Thus, the very objective of any Children’s Plan is undermined if the plan is acquired in the child’s name.Therefore, as far as possible, make sure that you, as a parent, are the Life Assured and the nominee or the beneficiary is your child. What are the factors to consider while buying a Children’s Plan?Consider the inflated costs of a normal educational course or any other requirements that your child might have in the future. This should be your targeted savings amount, which you would want to receive when the policy matures. Ideally, the term you should choose for the plan is when your child is in a position to require the money. Thereafter, you need to sit with your Relationship Manager to work out the amount to be invested and the level of protection required. Does HDFC SL offer Unit Linked plans within its entire range of Children’s Plans?Yes, the plan name is HDFC Young star super premium plan. Will I also be able to save tax through a Children’s Plan?Yes, you will be eligible for tax benefits under Section 80C and Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, subject to the provisions contained therein (tax benefits are subject to change in the tax laws. Please refer to the Tax Benefits section for more details)."

    - text: "We will determine your Home Loan Eligibility largely by your income and repayment capacity. Other important factors include your age, qualification, number of dependants, your spouses income (if any), assets & liabilities, savings history and the stability & continuity of occupation.What does an EMI mean?EMI refers to the ‘Equated Monthly Installment’ which is the amount you will pay to us on a specific date each month till the loan is repaid in full. The EMI comprises of the principal and interest components which are structured in a way that in the initial years of your loan, the interest component is much larger than the principal component, while towards the latter half of the loan, the principal component is much larger.What does ‘own contribution’ mean?‘Own Contribution’ is the total cost of the property less HDFC’s home loan.How do I repay a home loan ?For your convenience, HDFC offers various modes for repayment of the home loan. You may issue standing instructions to your banker to pay the installments through ECS (Electronic Clearing System), opt for direct deduction of monthly installments by your employer or issue post-dated cheques from your salary account.When can I make a home loan application?You can apply for a Home Loan at any time once you have decided to purchase or construct a property, even if you have not selected the property or the construction has not commenced.What does ‘market value’ of the property mean?Market value refers to the estimated amount that is expected to be fetched on the property as per the prevailing market conditions.How do i make a loan application?You could collect an application form from our nearest office or simply download it from our website and submit it yourself along with the supporting documents and the processing fee cheque at any HDFC office that is convenient to you. Alternatively you have the option to make an online application from anywhere in the world by clicking on ‘Instant Home Loan’ on our website and also know your Home Loan eligibility instantly.Do i get tax benefits on the loan?Yes. You are eligible for tax benefits on the principal and interest components of your Home Loan under the Income Tax Act, 1961. As the benefits could vary each year, please do check with our Loan Counselor about the tax benefits which you could avail on your loan.What security will i have to provide?Security of the loan would generally be security interest on the property being financed by us and / or any other collateral / interim security as may be required by us.It is extremely important for you to ensure that the title to the property is clear, marketable and free from encumbrance. There should not be any existing mortgage, loan or litigation, which is likely to adversely affect the title to the property.When do i start repaying the principal amount?Repayment of the principal commences from the month following the month in which you avail full disbursement of your loan. Pending final disbursement, you pay interest on the portion of the loan disbursed. This interest is called pre-EMI interest. Pre-EMI interest is payable every month from the date of each disbursement up to the date of commencement of EMI.In the case of under construction properties, HDFC also offers you a unique ‘Tranching’ facility wherein you can choose the installments you wish to pay till the time the property is ready for possession. Any amount over and above the interest which is paid by you goes towards principal repayment, thus helping you repay the loan faster. This is especially useful in case your disbursements are likely to be spread over a longer period of time.What does ’agreement to sell’ mean? Does it have to be registered?The ’Agreement to Sell’ in a property transaction is a legal document executed on a stamp paper that records in writing the understanding between the buyer and the seller and all the details of the property such as area, possession date, price etc.In many Indian states, the Agreement to Sell is required to be registered by law. We suggest that in your own interest you should register the Agreement within four months of the date of the Agreement at the office of the Sub-Registrar appointed by the State Government, under the Indian Registration Act, 1908.What does encumbrance refer to?Encumbrance on a property refers to claims or charges on the property due to liabilities such as unpaid loans and bills. It is critical that during your home search you consider properties which are free of encumbrances of any sort.Can i get a higher loan through my existing loan account to buy a new property?Yes, you could go in for a ‘Home Conversion Loan’ whereby your existing loan (which you took to buy your current home) could be transferred to the new house with additional funds for the incremental cost of the new house, subject to your loan eligibility. This means you can move into your new home without having to go through the hassle of pre-paying your existing loan.Can i apply for a loan to HDFC to repay a home loan availed by me from another bank / housing finance company?Yes, you can apply for a loan to us for repaying a Home Loan availed by you from another Bank / Housing Finance Company or even your employer. For more details on ‘Balance Transfer’ kindly contact our nearest office.What is an under construction property?An under construction property refers to a home which is in the process of being constructed and where possession would be handed over to the buyer at a subsequent date.When can i take disbursement of the loan?You can take disbursement of the loan once the property has been technically appraised, all legal documentation has been completed and you have invested your Own Contribution in full. You can submit the request for the disbursement of your loan by visiting any of our offices or online by logging on to ‘Online Access for Existing Customers’.In how many installments can you disburse the loan to me?Once we receive your request for disbursement, we will disburse the loan in full or in installments, which usually do not exceed three in number. In case of an under construction property, we will disburse your loan in installments based on the progress of construction, as assessed by us and not necessarily according to the developer’s agreement. You are advised in your own interest to enter into an agreement with the developer wherein the payments are linked to the construction work and not pre-defined on a time-based schedule.Can i repay my loan ahead of schedule?Yes, you can repay the loan ahead of schedule by making lump sum payments towards part or full prepayment, subject to the applicable prepayment charges. We also offer a free-of-charge facility to accelerate your loan repayment called ‘Accelerated Repayment Scheme’. This option provides you the flexibility to increase the EMIs every year in proportion to the increase in your income which will result in you repaying the loan much faster.Does the property have to be insured?Yes, you will have to ensure that your property is duly and properly insured for fire and other appropriate hazards during the pendency of the loan.

You don’t need to wait till 60 years of age. However, once you have fixed your vesting age, it is recommended that you continue for the entire term. I already have a Saving & Investment Plan in place. Do I also need a Pension Plan? What purpose would it serve?It’s nice to hear that you have already made provisions for your savings. However, the objective of a Pension Plan is very different. Pension Plans are insurance plans that offer you an income/ pension after retirement when you may not have any other adequate source of income.This is not possible with any other plan. Moreover, pension plans can’t be liquidated easily, which ensures that your savings stay intact and a kitty is automatically built for your retirement.

This plan aims to help you plan for a steady income source for retirement. You can choose from a variety of Premium paying & policy term options as per your comfort and plan your retirement.

To boost your fund value, you also have the pension multipliers that are added to your fund post 11th year. Why should I buy HDFC Life Assured Pension Plan?One of the biggest challenges of planning for your retirement is to ensure that you have saved enough money during your working years that will take care of your expenses once you retire. Given the rising cost of living, increased life expectancy and inflation, it is always wise to invest in a Pension Plan. HDFC Life Assured Pension Plan can help you achieve your retirement goals by planning for it well in advance.The charges seem very high, a lot of money would get deducted. This doesn’t look like a lucrative option to me.Yes, there are charges as every other ULIP plan, but there is also a Pension Multiplier from the 11th year onwards every alternate year. The longer policy term you go for, the more you gain through Pension Boosters added to the fund value.It is not possible for me to pay for such a long tenure since I have other commitments.HDFC Life APP comes to you with a host of flexibilities. You can choose a limited premium paying term of 8, 10 & 15 years. Also, there is an option to pay a lump sum through a single payment.HDFC Life APP is a ULIP Plan.

If that is not the case, unit-linked plans are the ideal vehicle for you to plan for your family’s future financial needs. Unit-linked plans are associated with transparent charging structure and certain flexibility, besides possessing the potential to deliver a higher amount on maturity. What do you mean by ‘switching funds’?Switching between funds implies that the policy holder can transfer his investments from one fund to another fund under the plan. This is usually done to change one’s investment pattern or strategy based on changes in the financial markets. For instance, one may want to switch from an equity based fund to a debt fund when the equity markets are on a downslide. What are the different types of Savings Plans?You may choose between a traditional endowment plan and unit-linked insurance plan depending on a number of factors including your risk profile, your understanding of different financial instruments and your ability to track your investments regularly. Therefore , those who are well aware of the financial markets, are willing to bear the investment risk and desire a higher return can look at unit linked products and vice versa.

    - text: "As a parent, your priority is your child’s future and being able to meet their dreams and aspirations. Providing a good education, establishing a professional career or even a modest wedding is becoming an expensive proposition with each passing year. Costs are increasing fast. Just imagine how much you will need when your young children tale these important steps in life in the future. With our Children’s Plans, you can start building regular savings today to help you secure your child’s immediate and future needs even when you are not around. Should I buy a plan in my Child’s name or in my own name?When purchasing a Life Insurance plan, it is important to remember that its main purpose is to replace an income that is lost in case of the unfortunate demise of the chief bread winner of the family (Life Assured). A child rarely has an income and therefore has no reason to be insured. If the Insurance Plan is taken in name of the child, the plan gets derailed in case of the unfortunate demise of the parent. Thus, the very objective of any Children’s Plan is undermined if the plan is acquired in the child’s name.Therefore, as far as possible, make sure that you, as a parent, are the Life Assured and the nominee or the beneficiary is your child. What are the factors to consider while buying a Children’s Plan?Consider the inflated costs of a normal educational course or any other requirements that your child might have in the future. This should be your targeted savings amount, which you would want to receive when the policy matures. Ideally, the term you should choose for the plan is when your child is in a position to require the money. Thereafter, you need to sit with your Relationship Manager to work out the amount to be invested and the level of protection required. Does HDFC SL offer Unit Linked plans within its entire range of Children’s Plans?Yes, the plan name is HDFC Young star super premium plan. Will I also be able to save tax through a Children’s Plan?Yes, you will be eligible for tax benefits under Section 80C and Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, subject to the provisions contained therein (tax benefits are subject to change in the tax laws. Please refer to the Tax Benefits section for more details)."
